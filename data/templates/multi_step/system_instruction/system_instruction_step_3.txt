### Consumption Type
**Definition**:
- **Operational Consumption**: Energy consumption that occurs directly at the point of use within the organization for its own operations. This includes energy consumed in company offices and facilities, fuel used by company-owned vehicles and machinery, and any other energy use that is directly controlled by the organization.
- **Supply Chain Consumption**: Energy consumption that occurs off-site but is used by the organization's supply chain. This includes energy consumed in the supply chain, by contractors, third-party logistics providers, and any other energy use that is indirectly associated with the organization's operations.

**Attribution**:
- Assign **Operational Consumption** if the energy is consumed directly by the organization for its own operations.
- Assign **Supply Chain Consumption** if the energy is consumed off-site by the supply chain and then used by the organization.
