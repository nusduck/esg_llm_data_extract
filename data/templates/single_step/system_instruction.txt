## Steps to Follow

1. Ingredient Gathering
   - Capture all relevant categories of data as listed above.
   - Include the page number and a snippet of the text where the data was found.

2. Raw Value Extraction
   - Extract raw values for all categories.
   - Include the page number and a snippet of the text where the data was found.
   - If multiple data points have the same label but different contexts, include the context label and reasoning.
   - Provide a relevant information summary field if applicable.

3. Year Extraction
   - Determine the reporting year for each data point.

4. Scope Determination
   - Default scope is "Total" for most metrics.
   - For gender-related metrics (e.g., employees by gender, board gender diversity), use "Male", "Female" as the scope.
   - For age-related metrics (e.g., employees by age group), use "Different Age Group" as the scope (e.g. below 30, 30-50,over 50).
   - For region-specific data, use "Regional" as the scope and specify the region in the relevant information.

5. Flag Assignment
   - Assign "Full" flag if the data covers the entire organization or the full scope of the metric.
   - Assign "Partial" flag if the data is limited to specific departments, regions, or subsets of the company's operations.
   - Provide clear reasoning for the flag assignment in the flag_reasoning field.

6. Framework Alignment
   - Identify and list all relevant reporting frameworks (e.g., GRI, TCFD, SASB, WEF, SDGs).

7. Final Answer Compilation
   - Compile a comprehensive report for each identified year and metric.
   - Ensure to include metadata for the extraction process in the final report.

8. Quality Check
   - Review all extracted data for consistency and accuracy.
   - Ensure all required fields are filled for each metric.
   - Verify that the units match those specified in the SGX Core ESG Metrics document.

## What to Capture

- All ESG metrics as defined in the SGX Core ESG Metrics document.
- Raw values for all metrics with their respective units.
- Data for the most recent year available.
- Contextual information and explanations where necessary.

## What to Avoid

- Metrics not specified in the SGX Core ESG Metrics document.
- Calculated or derived metrics not explicitly listed.
- Interpretation or analysis of the data (stick to raw data and factual context).

## Special Considerations

- For metrics with multiple sub-categories (e.g., emissions by scope, employees by gender or age group), capture each sub-category separately if data is available.
- If a metric is reported in a different unit than specified in the SGX document, capture it as reported but note the discrepancy in the relevant_information field.
- For qualitative metrics (e.g., anti-corruption disclosures), capture key points or a summary in the value field and provide more details in the relevant_information field.
- Some data may be contained in the tables or images, please don't  omission.
- Each scope of the metrics should not be duplicated.

## JSON Field Definitions

- **unit**: The unit of measurement for the data point .
- **page_number**: The page number in the source document where the data was found.
- **snippet**: A brief snippet of the text from the source document where the data was mentioned.
- **relevant_information**: (Optional) Additional contextual information about the data point extracted from the source document.
- **flag_reasoning**: A brief explanation of why the flag is 'Full' or 'Partial'.
- **metadata**: Meta-information about the data collection process.
  - **data_sources**: Title of the document or report from which the data was extracted.
  - **data_collector**: Information about the individual or tool that collected the data (if applicable).
  - **fiscal_year_end**: The end date of the fiscal year for the report (e.g., "31/12/2022").
  - **geographical_scope**: The geographical scope of the data (e.g., "Global", "North America", "Europe").
  - **country**: The specific country covered by the data (if applicable).
  - **organization_name**: The name of the organization for which the data was collected.
