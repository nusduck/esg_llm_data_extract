In particular, oil, gas and coal, which are the supply of fossil fuels, are responsible for 73 per cent of direct emissions globally. The power, automotive, real estate and steel sectors, through downstream usage of electricity, passenger cars, iron, steel and buildings, account for 67 per cent of emissions arising from fossil fuel combustion. Our targets in these sectors reflect our ambition to facilitate this change end to end."}
