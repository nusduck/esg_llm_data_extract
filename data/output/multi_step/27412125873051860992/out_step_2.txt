The climate strategy is an annex to the Sustainability\nPolicy and describes the commitments undertaken by the Group in its three main areas of intervention:\n\u2022\n\u2022\nReal estate development and management activities\nThe Group is committed to a 46.2% reduction by the end of 2030 in Scope 1 and 2 emissions linked to consumption of electricity,\ngas and other energy sources for all buildings over which the Group has direct control, from the operating sites and those of\nthe diversified companies to the real estate where the UNA Group operates and the foreign sites, in line with climate science\nand in particular with the scenario of limiting the increase in the global average temperature to within 1.5\u00b0C.\nInvestment activities\nIn May 2022, the Unipol Group joined the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, thus committing to reducing the emissions of its\ninvestment portfolios to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and acting to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through\nthe engagement of investee companies, defining specific interim targets.\n\u2022\nUnderwriting activities\nUnipol is committed to developing a range of insurance products and services to support customers in mitigating and adapting to climate\nchange. Within the 2022-2024 Strategic Plan, the Group again decided to set a target connected to the incidence of products with social\nand environmental value, establishing an objective of 30% to be reached by the end of 2024.\nTo support customers in the transition to a low-carbon economy, Unipol will develop products that incentivise its MV customers to\nreduce their emissions, with the support of telematics, and will pay increasing attention to reducing the environmental impacts of the\nclaims management process, implementing circular economy approaches. Companies that derive 30% or more of their revenues from\ncoal mining or the generation of electricity from thermal coal and companies that adopt unconventional mining practices are excluded\nfrom the underwriting of insurance products.",
